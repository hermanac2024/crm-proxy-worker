Cloudflare Worker MA Proxy ‚Äî Overview
üìå Purpose:
This Worker acts as a transparent HTTP(S) reverse proxy hosted on Cloudflare‚Äôs edge network. It:

Forwards incoming requests to your backend server(s).

Hides your backend server IPs from users and potential censors.

Minimizes fingerprinting by stripping headers that might reveal proxying.

Automatically fails over to a backup backend if the primary backend fails.

Logs basic request information for debugging and monitoring.

The Worker sits inside Cloudflare global edge.

Looks like normal Cloudflare CDN traffic.

Censors see only Worker domain, never the backend.

TLS termination happens at Cloudflare; backend TLS never exposed directly.

‚öôÔ∏è How it works:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Request arrives at the Worker URL (which can be bound to a subdomain like cdn.yourdomain.com).

2Ô∏è‚É£ URL Rewriting:

The Worker reads the incoming request URL (originalUrl).

It reconstructs the full URL for the backend (preserving path and query string) for both primary and backup backends.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Header Sanitization (Stealth Mode):

Clones the original request headers.

Deletes Cloudflare-specific headers (cf-connecting-ip, cf-ipcountry, cf-ray, etc.) to minimize leaking information to the backend.

Updates Host header to match the backend hostname.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Forward request to the primary backend (primaryBackend) using fetch().

5Ô∏è‚É£ Failover logic:

If the primary backend fails (non-200 response or network error), the Worker automatically retries the backup backend (backupBackend).

6Ô∏è‚É£ Response Sanitization:

Clones backend response headers.

Strips identifying headers like Server, X-Powered-By, and Via.

Adds a custom header X-Worker-Proxy: Cloudflare Stealth Proxy for debugging.

Adds X-Used-Backend to show which backend was used.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Logging:

Logs each request event (path, backend used, full client IP from cf-connecting-ip) for minimal monitoring.

üõ°Ô∏è Stealth and Security Features:
Feature	Purpose
Header sanitization	Prevents backend leaks, makes proxy invisible to passive observers
Failover support	Improves uptime and resilience if primary is blocked
Logging	Allows minimal debugging and monitoring
Cloudflare edge hosting	Distributes proxy globally; blends into normal Cloudflare traffic

üîß Customization points:
Backends: You can configure any number of backends in the tryBackends array.

Headers: You can add/remove which headers to strip depending on backend behavior.

Logging: You can enhance or limit logging as needed.

Authentication: (optional) can be added for access control.



‚úÖ Use wrangler tail if you want real-time logs (if using CLI)

wrangler tail
You will see logs like:

[2025-06-20T06:12:34.567Z] Path: /api/data, Backend: primary-backend.com, ClientIP: 192.168 *.*
